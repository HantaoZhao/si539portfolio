		<h1> My internship experience </h1>
		<h2> Shanghai Renmin Electical Apparatus Works </h2> 
		<h2> Aug 2018 - Sep 2018 </h2>

	<p id="itn_p1"> 
		I briefly worked as an intern at the company's R&D department for a month during my summer vacation in 2018, when I had finished all the compulsory courses related to electric circuits at my sophomore year. I was filled with determination to apply the knowlegde and formula I learned in classes into practice.

	<p id="itn_p2">
		At the beginning, I felt at a loss when confronted with the circuit drawings full of alien symbols. Needless to say, the circuit diagrams of the apparatus are a thousand times more complicated than what I learned in classes, and appear definitely to be formidable for new hands.	
	</p>

	<p  id="itn_p3">
		Fortunately, my mentor patiently explained to me the features of these novel electrical components, and guided me through how the components work together to function as modules. 
		<!-- Analyzed the working principles of the apparatus according to the circuit drawings.  -->
	</p>

	<p  id="itn_p4">
		Besides, the apparatus need to send signals to the server, and switch between different modes based on the received instructions. My co-workers was implementing and testing the communication software, and I designed a great amount of random test cases by applying the programming skills I learned in classes.
	</p>

	<p  id="itn_p5">
		<!-- Assisted the implementation of communication software to facilitate the transimission of signals between servers and apparatus. -->
		I felt really nice when I could help my co-workers and put what I have learned into real industrial production. The compliment and encouragement from my mentor and co-workers made me so proud. This internship experience greatly strengthened my determination to further my study, and motivated me to study diligently.
