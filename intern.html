		<li> <strong>Shanghai Renmin Electical Apparatus Works</strong> <p> Aug 2018 - Sep 2018 </p></li>

			I briefly worked as an intern at the company's R&D department for a month during my summer vacation in 2018, when I had finished all the compulsory courses related to electric circuits at my sophomore year. I was filled with determination to apply the knowlegde and formula I learned in classes into practice.

			At the beginning, I felt at a loss when confronted with the circuit drawings full of alien symbols. Needless to say, the circuit diagrams of the apparatus are a thousand times more complicated than what I learned in classes, and appear definitely to be formidable for new hands.

			Fortunately, my mentor patiently explained to me the features of the novel electrical components, and guided me through how the components work together to function as modules. 

			Analyzed the working principles of the apparatus according to the circuit drawings. 

			Besides, the apparatus need to send signals to the server, and switch between different modes based on the received instructions. My co-workers was implementing and testing the communication software, and I designed a great amount of random test cases by applying the programming skills I learned at school.


			<!-- Assisted the implementation of communication software to facilitate the transimission of signals between servers and apparatus. -->

			I felt really nice when I could help my co-workers and put what I have learned into real industrial production. The compliment and encouragement from my mentor and co-workers made me so proud.

			This internship experience greatly strengthened my determination to further my study.
